# TabzChrome Beads Configuration
# Note: Custom issue types are NOT supported in beads v0.46
# Use labels and custom statuses instead for workflow differentiation

# Conductor workflow approach:
# - Labels distinguish work type: conductor, worker, wave, cross-train
# - Custom statuses track pipeline stages (configured via bd config)
#
# Custom statuses configured:
#   awaiting_review   - Work complete, needs review
#   awaiting_merge    - Review passed, ready to merge
#   awaiting_wave     - Blocked on wave completion
#   assigned_worker   - Assigned to a worker session
#
# Example usage:
#   bd create --title "Merge wave-1 PRs" --label conductor
#   bd create --title "Implement feature X" --label worker
#   bd set-state <id> status=awaiting_review
#   bd list --label conductor
#   bd list --label "status:awaiting_merge"
