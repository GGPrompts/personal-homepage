Currently, the Ready column uses a faulty heuristic in `useBeadsBan.ts` that checks if `issue.description.trim().length \u003e 0` to determine if an issue is \"ready\". This doesn't match beads actual logic.\n\n**Current behavior (lines 222-230 in useBeadsBan.ts):**\n```typescript\nif (issue.description \u0026\u0026 issue.description.trim().length \u003e 0) {\n  return 'ready'\n}\nreturn 'backlog'\n```\n\n**Problem:** Issues with any description show as Ready, but they might have blockers or lack a prepared worker prompt.\n\n## Specific Changes Required\n\n### 1. Add fetchReady() function\nCreate a new API wrapper function (around line 117 in useBeadsBan.ts) that calls the new `/api/beads/ready` endpoint:\n\n```typescript\nasync function fetchReady(workspace?: string): Promise\u003cstring[]\u003e {\n  try {\n    const params = workspace ? `?workspace=${encodeURIComponent(workspace)}` : ''\n    const res = await fetch(`/api/beads/ready${params}`)\n    if (!res.ok) return []\n    const data = await res.json()\n    return data.ready?.map((issue: BeadsApiIssue) =\u003e issue.id) ?? []\n  } catch {\n    return []\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Update getColumnForIssue() logic (lines 206-230)\nReplace the description-based heuristic with a Set lookup:\n\n**Modify getColumnForIssue() to accept a readyIssueIds parameter:**\n\n```typescript\nfunction getColumnForIssue(\n  issue: BeadsApiIssue,\n  readyIssueIds: Set\u003cstring\u003e\n): BeadsBanColumnId {\n  const status = issue.status?.toLowerCase()\n  const hasBlockers = issue.blockedBy \u0026\u0026 issue.blockedBy.length \u003e 0\n\n  if (status === 'closed' || status === 'done') {\n    return 'done'\n  }\n  if (status === 'blocked' || (status === 'open' \u0026\u0026 hasBlockers)) {\n    return 'blocked'\n  }\n  if (status === 'in_progress' || status === 'in-progress') {\n    return 'in-progress'\n  }\n  \n  // Use bd ready to determine if issue is ready\n  if (status === 'open' \u0026\u0026 readyIssueIds.has(issue.id)) {\n    return 'ready'\n  }\n  return 'backlog'\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update refresh() callback (lines 286-353)\nFetch the ready issues list and pass it to getColumnForIssue():\n\n- Call `fetchReady()` alongside `fetchIssues()` at the beginning of the refresh logic (around line 293)\n- Convert the array to a Set for O(1) lookup: `const readySet = new Set(readyIds)`\n- Pass `readySet` to all `getColumnForIssue(issue, readySet)` calls in the loop (line 309)\n\n## Integration with /api/beads/ready\n\nThe new endpoint (personal-homepage-cp7) will:\n- Accept GET request with optional `?workspace=PATH` query param\n- Return `{ ready: BeadsApiIssue[] }` containing only issues that `bd ready --json` returns\n- Issues in this list have:\n  - `status: 'open'`\n  - No blockers (blockedBy array is empty or undefined)\n  - Prepared worker prompts (notes field contains prepared.prompt)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `fetchReady()` function added and correctly calls `/api/beads/ready`\n- [ ] `getColumnForIssue()` signature updated to accept `readyIssueIds: Set\u003cstring\u003e`\n- [ ] All calls to `getColumnForIssue()` pass the Set from `fetchReady()`\n- [ ] Ready column now shows only issues returned by `bd ready --json`\n- [ ] Backlog column shows open issues without blockers that aren't in the ready list\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors\n- [ ] Manual test: Open kanban board, verify Ready column matches `bd ready --json` output\n- [ ] No regression: Other columns (In Progress, Blocked, Done) unchanged\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. **Unit logic:** Verify `getColumnForIssue()` correctly routes issues based on the readySet\n2. **Integration:** Load kanban board and check Ready column matches `bd ready --json`\n3. **Edge cases:**\n   - Issue with blockers but prepared prompt: should be in Blocked, not Ready\n   - Open issue with prepared prompt but no blockers: should be in Ready\n   - Create a test issue, prepare it, verify it moves to Ready\n\n## Notes\n\n- The /api/beads/ready endpoint will be the source of truth for Ready column\n- This maintains the 5-column structure (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Blocked, Done)\n- Error handling: if `/api/beads/ready` fails, readySet will be empty and all open issues go to Backlog (safe fallback)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-23T02:06:33.999421204-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-23T02:33:56.839152207-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-23T02:33:56.839152207-05:00","close_reason":"Merged into personal-homepage-cp7 - single worker will create endpoint and wire it up","labels":["beads","kanban","wave-1"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"personal-homepage-a6y","depends_on_id":"personal-homepage-cp7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T02:06:44.971783066-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Spawn options (new window, embedded, specific directory)\n\nReference: ~/projects/TabzChrome extension source\n\nOutput: Document findings and propose enhancements for:\n- Bookmarks section terminal commands\n- Potential new 'Launcher' or 'Profiles' section\n- Integration with existing terminal extension bridge","notes":"## Research Findings: TabzChrome Profiles UI\n\n### 1. Profile Card Layout \u0026 Styling\n\n**Card Structure:**\n- 3-column grid (90px min-width, responsive)\n- Dark surface (#0a0a0c) with border (#222225), 12px radius\n- **3px colored accent bar at top** (category color, 60%→100% opacity on hover)\n- 36x36px icon in elevated background\n- JetBrains Mono font (0.75rem), truncated with ellipsis\n- Keyboard shortcut badge (1-6) in top-right corner\n- Subtle lift effect on hover: `translateY(-2px)` + enhanced shadow\n\n**Key CSS:**\n```css\n.profile-card::before {\n  height: 3px;\n  background: var(--card-accent, var(--accent));\n  opacity: 0.6;\n}\n.profile-card:hover {\n  transform: translateY(-2px);\n  box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Quick-Launch Options\n\n**Keyboard Shortcuts:**\n- `1-9`: Spawn profile by index (top 6 displayed)\n- `Ctrl+Shift+Y`: Spawn quick popout terminal\n- `/`: Focus command bar search\n\n**Click Actions:**\n- Single click → Spawn terminal with profile settings\n- Reference link icon → Open profile's reference URL/file\n\n### 3. Profile Categories \u0026 Organization\n\n**Data Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface Profile {\n  id: string\n  name: string              // Emoji prefix supported\n  category?: string         // Groups profiles\n  workingDir: string\n  command?: string          // Auto-run on spawn\n  color?: string\n  pinnedToNewTab?: boolean  // Show in main grid (limit 6)\n}\n\ninterface CategorySettings {\n  [name: string]: {\n    color: string           // Hex color\n    collapsed?: boolean\n    order?: number\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Sorting Logic:**\n1. Pinned profiles first\n2. Default profile next\n3. Remaining alphabetically\n4. Top 6 displayed in grid, rest in dropdown\n\n### 4. Visual Indicators\n\n- **Accent bar**: Category color at card top\n- **Icon wrapper**: 36x36px with category-colored emoji/icon\n- **Default badge**: \"def\" indicator bottom-right\n- **Keyboard badge**: Numbers 1-6 for quick access\n- **Dropdown indicators**: Colored dots, category counts, chevron icons\n- **Focus ring**: Green outline (#00ff88) on keyboard navigation\n\n### 5. Spawn Options\n\n| Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| Sidebar | Default, embedded in sidepanel |\n| Popout Window | 700x500 popup via `chrome.windows.create()` |\n| Working Directory | Profile-specific or global default |\n\n**Message Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface SpawnTerminalMessage {\n  type: 'SPAWN_TERMINAL'\n  name: string\n  workingDir: string\n  command?: string\n  useTmux: boolean\n  pasteOnly?: boolean\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Enhancements for personal-homepage\n\n### A. Bookmarks Section Terminal Commands\n\n**Current State:** Terminal commands exist in bookmarks with `data-tabz-*` attributes.\n\n**Proposed Enhancements:**\n\n1. **Visual Improvements:**\n   - Add colored category accent bars (3px left border or top bar)\n   - Show keyboard shortcuts (1-9) for quick launch\n   - Icon with category-color background\n   - Hover lift effect with shadow\n\n2. **Quick Launch:**\n   - Number keys 1-9 spawn command by index\n   - `/` focuses search/filter input\n   - Click spawns in sidebar, Shift+Click popout window\n\n3. **Working Directory:**\n   - Global working directory selector dropdown\n   - Recent directories list (5-10 entries)\n   - Per-command directory override option\n\n4. **Command Cards:**\n```tsx\n// Enhanced bookmark command card\n\u003cdiv className=\"relative bg-surface border rounded-xl p-4 cursor-pointer\n               hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:shadow-lg transition-all\"\u003e\n  {/* Category accent bar */}\n  \u003cdiv className=\"absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 h-[3px] rounded-t-xl\n                  bg-emerald-500/60 hover:bg-emerald-500\" /\u003e\n  \n  {/* Keyboard badge */}\n  \u003cspan className=\"absolute top-2 right-2 text-xs text-muted\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e\n  \n  {/* Icon + content */}\n  \u003cdiv className=\"flex items-center gap-3\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv className=\"w-9 h-9 rounded-lg bg-emerald-500/20 flex items-center justify-center\"\u003e\n      \u003cTerminal className=\"w-5 h-5 text-emerald-400\" /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className=\"font-mono text-sm\"\u003e{command.name}\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className=\"text-xs text-muted\"\u003e{command.description}\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### B.

{"id":"personal-homepage-jaj","title":"Investigate TabzChrome new tab search bar for Search Hub enhancements","description":"The TabzChrome new tab page has a search bar that matches against multiple sources:\n- Bookmarks\n- Terminal profiles\n- And more\n\nThis works really well and could inform enhancements to the Search Hub section or provide a unified quick-launch experience.\n\nReference: ~/projects/TabzChrome new tab page implementation","notes":"## Research Findings: TabzChrome New Tab Search Bar\n\n### 1. How the CommandBar Works\n\nThe search bar is implemented in `extension/newtab/components/CommandBar.tsx`. Key features:\n\n- **Single unified input** with `$` prefix aesthetic (terminal-style)\n- **Live suggestions dropdown** appearing as user types\n- **Auto-focus on mount** with 300ms delay for smooth UX\n- **Debounced bookmark search** (150ms) to avoid excessive API calls\n\n### 2. Search Sources\n\nThe CommandBar searches against **4 data sources**:\n\n1. **URLs** - Detects URL patterns (http/https or domain-like strings like `github.com`)\n2. **Terminal Profiles** - Matches profile name OR category via simple `includes()` string matching\n3. **Recent Directories** - File paths matching the query\n4. **Chrome Bookmarks** - Using `chrome.bookmarks.search()` API with 150ms debounce\n\nFallback: If no matches found and not a URL, suggests a Google search.\n\n### 3. Matching Logic\n\n**NOT fuzzy matching** - uses simple `toLowerCase().includes()` for profiles/dirs.\n\nMatching priorities in suggestion generation order:\n1. URL detection first (if looks like URL)\n2. Profile matches (up to 4 results)\n3. Directory matches (up to 3 results)\n4. Bookmark matches (up to 5 results)\n5. Fallback search suggestion\n\n### 4. UI Patterns\n\n**Keyboard Navigation:**\n- `ArrowDown/Tab` - Next suggestion\n- `ArrowUp/Shift+Tab` - Previous suggestion\n- `Enter` - Execute selected action\n- `Escape` - Close suggestions, clear input\n- `/` key (from NewTab.tsx) - Focus search from anywhere on page\n- `1-9` keys - Quick spawn profiles by index\n\n**Visual Design:**\n- Each suggestion has: icon, title, subtitle, action badge\n- Color-coded icons by type (profile color or amber for bookmarks)\n- Selected state with left border accent\n- CRT-inspired aesthetic with scanlines/noise overlays\n\n**Suggestion Item Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface Suggestion {\n  type: 'profile' | 'url' | 'search' | 'dir' | 'bookmark'\n  id: string\n  title: string\n  subtitle?: string\n  icon?: React.ReactNode\n  color?: string\n  action: () =\u003e void\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Additional Features\n\n**Omnibox Integration** (`background/omnibox.ts`):\n- `term \u003ccommand\u003e` from Chrome address bar\n- Profile suggestions, URL handling, common commands\n- Max 5 suggestions\n\n**Web Shortcuts Grid:**\n- Pulls from Chrome bookmarks \"New Tab\" or \"Favorites\" folder\n- Google favicon API for icons\n- Grid layout with hover effects\n\n### 6. Enhancement Ideas for Search Hub\n\n**High-Impact:**\n1. **Unified quick-launch bar** - Single input that searches bookmarks + engines + AI services\n2. **Keyboard shortcuts** - `1-9` for engine selection, `/` to focus\n3. **Suggestion dropdown** - Show matching bookmarks/recent searches as user types\n4. **Type-ahead with categories** - Group suggestions by source (bookmark, engine, recent)\n\n**Medium-Impact:**\n1. **Command palette style** - `Cmd+K` to open overlay search\n2. **Shortcut prefixes** - `b:` for bookmarks, `g:` for google, etc.\n3. **Debounced search** - Prevent excessive API calls while typing\n4. **Mouse hover selection** - Update selected index on hover\n\n**Lower-Priority:**\n1. **Recent directories** integration (if terminal support exists)\n2. **Chrome bookmarks API** (would need extension context)\n3. **CRT visual effects** (might not fit homepage aesthetic)\n\n### Key Files Reference\n\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/newtab/components/CommandBar.tsx` - Main search component\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/newtab/NewTab.tsx` - Parent with keyboard shortcuts\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/newtab/styles/newtab.css` - Styling patterns\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/background/omnibox.ts` - Address bar integration","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-04T23:06:59.135697628-05:00","created_by":"matt","updated_at":"2026-01-05T09:53:28.014469186-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-05T09:53:28.014469186-05:00","close_reason":"Research complete: Documented TabzChrome CommandBar patterns, search sources, and enhancement ideas for Search Hub in issue notes"}

{"id":"personal-homepage-v5x","title":"Music Audit: Consolidate duplicate device selectors","description":"## Bug: Duplicate Device Selectors Out of Sync\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThere are **two independent device selectors** that don't share state:\n\n1. **PersistentMusicDrawer.tsx** (lines 272-309)\n   - Uses `player.devices` from `useMusicPlayerSafe()`\n   - Calls `player.refreshDevices()` and `player.switchDevice()`\n   - Device list: `player.devices`\n   - Current device: `player.deviceId`\n\n2. **SpotifyPlayer.tsx** (lines 201-239 - DeviceSelector component)\n   - Receives `devices`, `currentDeviceId`, `onSelect`, `onRefresh` as props\n   - Used at line ~470 with same `devices` array from `useSpotifyPlayer`\n\n### Why They Desync\nBoth use the **same hook** (`useSpotifyPlayer`) but:\n- `PersistentMusicDrawer` accesses via `MusicPlayerProvider` context\n- `SpotifyPlayer` calls `useSpotifyPlayer` directly (separate instance!)\n- When one refreshes, the other doesn't update\n\n### Solution Options\n**Option A (Recommended):** Remove device selector from SpotifyPlayer.tsx since PersistentMusicDrawer is always visible\n**Option B:** Make SpotifyPlayer.tsx use the MusicPlayerProvider context instead of calling useSpotifyPlayer directly\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `components/SpotifyPlayer.tsx` - Remove DeviceSelector or use context\n- Ensure single source of truth for device state\n\n### Test Steps\n1. Open music player section\n2. Verify only one device selector visible\n3. Switch devices and verify state is consistent","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-09T14:43:18.228094794-05:00","created_by":"marci","updated_at":"2026-01-09T15:16:00.824468397-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T15:16:00.824468397-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed in commits 944f992 and 2cfa67a"}
