{"id":"personal-homepage-jaj","title":"Investigate TabzChrome new tab search bar for Search Hub enhancements","description":"The TabzChrome new tab page has a search bar that matches against multiple sources:\n- Bookmarks\n- Terminal profiles\n- And more\n\nThis works really well and could inform enhancements to the Search Hub section or provide a unified quick-launch experience.\n\nReference: ~/projects/TabzChrome new tab page implementation","notes":"## Research Findings: TabzChrome New Tab Search Bar\n\n### 1. How the CommandBar Works\n\nThe search bar is implemented in `extension/newtab/components/CommandBar.tsx`. Key features:\n\n- **Single unified input** with `$` prefix aesthetic (terminal-style)\n- **Live suggestions dropdown** appearing as user types\n- **Auto-focus on mount** with 300ms delay for smooth UX\n- **Debounced bookmark search** (150ms) to avoid excessive API calls\n\n### 2. Search Sources\n\nThe CommandBar searches against **4 data sources**:\n\n1. **URLs** - Detects URL patterns (http/https or domain-like strings like `github.com`)\n2. **Terminal Profiles** - Matches profile name OR category via simple `includes()` string matching\n3. **Recent Directories** - File paths matching the query\n4. **Chrome Bookmarks** - Using `chrome.bookmarks.search()` API with 150ms debounce\n\nFallback: If no matches found and not a URL, suggests a Google search.\n\n### 3. Matching Logic\n\n**NOT fuzzy matching** - uses simple `toLowerCase().includes()` for profiles/dirs.\n\nMatching priorities in suggestion generation order:\n1. URL detection first (if looks like URL)\n2. Profile matches (up to 4 results)\n3. Directory matches (up to 3 results)\n4. Bookmark matches (up to 5 results)\n5. Fallback search suggestion\n\n### 4. UI Patterns\n\n**Keyboard Navigation:**\n- `ArrowDown/Tab` - Next suggestion\n- `ArrowUp/Shift+Tab` - Previous suggestion\n- `Enter` - Execute selected action\n- `Escape` - Close suggestions, clear input\n- `/` key (from NewTab.tsx) - Focus search from anywhere on page\n- `1-9` keys - Quick spawn profiles by index\n\n**Visual Design:**\n- Each suggestion has: icon, title, subtitle, action badge\n- Color-coded icons by type (profile color or amber for bookmarks)\n- Selected state with left border accent\n- CRT-inspired aesthetic with scanlines/noise overlays\n\n**Suggestion Item Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface Suggestion {\n  type: 'profile' | 'url' | 'search' | 'dir' | 'bookmark'\n  id: string\n  title: string\n  subtitle?: string\n  icon?: React.ReactNode\n  color?: string\n  action: () =\u003e void\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Additional Features\n\n**Omnibox Integration** (`background/omnibox.ts`):\n- `term \u003ccommand\u003e` from Chrome address bar\n- Profile suggestions, URL handling, common commands\n- Max 5 suggestions\n\n**Web Shortcuts Grid:**\n- Pulls from Chrome bookmarks \"New Tab\" or \"Favorites\" folder\n- Google favicon API for icons\n- Grid layout with hover effects\n\n### 6. Enhancement Ideas for Search Hub\n\n**High-Impact:**\n1. **Unified quick-launch bar** - Single input that searches bookmarks + engines + AI services\n2. **Keyboard shortcuts** - `1-9` for engine selection, `/` to focus\n3. **Suggestion dropdown** - Show matching bookmarks/recent searches as user types\n4. **Type-ahead with categories** - Group suggestions by source (bookmark, engine, recent)\n\n**Medium-Impact:**\n1. **Command palette style** - `Cmd+K` to open overlay search\n2. **Shortcut prefixes** - `b:` for bookmarks, `g:` for google, etc.\n3. **Debounced search** - Prevent excessive API calls while typing\n4. **Mouse hover selection** - Update selected index on hover\n\n**Lower-Priority:**\n1. **Recent directories** integration (if terminal support exists)\n2. **Chrome bookmarks API** (would need extension context)\n3. **CRT visual effects** (might not fit homepage aesthetic)\n\n### Key Files Reference\n\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/newtab/components/CommandBar.tsx` - Main search component\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/newtab/NewTab.tsx` - Parent with keyboard shortcuts\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/newtab/styles/newtab.css` - Styling patterns\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/background/omnibox.ts` - Address bar integration","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-04T23:06:59.135697628-05:00","created_by":"matt","updated_at":"2026-01-05T09:53:28.014469186-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-05T09:53:28.014469186-05:00","close_reason":"Research complete: Documented TabzChrome CommandBar patterns, search sources, and enhancement ideas for Search Hub in issue notes"}
