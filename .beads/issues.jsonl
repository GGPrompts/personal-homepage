These issues block the terminal automation workflow for users importing profiles.\n\n### Task\nFix the spawn handler and event propagation for TabzChrome profile bookmarks:\n1. Ensure clicking spawn on a profile bookmark calls spawnWithOptions() instead of sendToChat()\n2. Prevent click events from bubbling up and triggering edit mode via ContextMenuTrigger\n3. Verify the correct spawn handler is invoked for imported profiles with proper options (name, workingDir, profile)\n\n### Approach\nUse the frontend-development skill for React event handling patterns.\n\nWhen examining the code:\n- The issue is in bookmarks.tsx where profile bookmarks are rendered with onClick handlers\n- Check if the spawn handler is missing or if sendToChat flag is incorrectly set for imported profiles\n- Look at the ContextMenuTrigger/ContextMenu wrapper - it may need stopPropagation() on the button to prevent edit mode trigger\n- Verify that spawnWithOptions receives the profile parameter correctly from bookmark.profile\n\nKey patterns:\n- Terminal bookmarks use handleLaunchTerminal() which calls runCommand() from useTerminalExtension\n- For profile bookmarks, use spawnWithOptions() instead to support the profile parameter\n- The onClick handler should call e.stopPropagation() to prevent context menu from triggering edit\n\n### Key Files\n- app/sections/bookmarks.tsx (lines 1020-1040 for grid view button handler, lines 1250-1270 for list view)\n- hooks/useTerminalExtension.ts (for spawnWithOptions signature)\n- docs/tabz-integration.md (for TabzChrome profile import/spawn patterns)\n\n### When Done\nClose issue: bd close personal-homepage-8ew --reason \"Fixed profile bookmark spawn handler - now calls spawnWithOptions for profiles and prevents edit mode trigger via stopPropagation\"","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-21T01:52:33.356398993-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-21T19:58:01.976577379-05:00","labels":["bookmarks","ready","tabz","ui"]}

{"id":"personal-homepage-91k","title":"Add Prompts Playground for A/B testing models and prompts","description":"# Prompts Playground - Quad-Split Browser Viewer\n\n## Overview\n\nA 2x2 grid of browser panels for watching 4 agents build the same component simultaneously. Each agent works in an isolated project directory with its own dev server. You send them all the same prompt and watch the hot-reloading results side by side.\n\n**Note:** Agent chat/terminals are visible in TabzChrome sidebar - this component is purely the visual comparison view.\n\n## Use Case\n\n1. Spawn 4 agents (via TabzChrome sidebar terminals)\n2. Each runs in isolated directory with own dev server (ports 3001-3004)\n3. Send same prompt to all: \"Build a login form\"\n4. Watch all 4 build it differently in real-time via quad-split view\n5. Compare approaches, pick the best implementation\n6. **Save the winning component** with prompt + agent metadata for re-use\n\n## Proposed UI\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Prompts Playground                    [⚙️ Config]│\n├───────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┤\n│ Agent 1: opus+coder   │ Agent 2: sonnet+review  │\n│ ┌─────────────────┐   │ ┌─────────────────┐     │\n│ │ localhost:3001  │   │ │ localhost:3002  │     │\n│ │                 │   │ │                 │     │\n│ │  [Live Preview] │   │ │  [Live Preview] │     │\n│ │                 │   │ │                 │     │\n│ │   [💾 Save]     │   │ │   [💾 Save]     │     │\n│ └─────────────────┘   │ └─────────────────┘     │\n├───────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤\n│ Agent 3: codex/o3     │ Agent 4: haiku+fast     │\n│ ┌─────────────────┐   │ ┌─────────────────┐     │\n│ │ localhost:3003  │   │ │ localhost:3004  │     │\n│ │                 │   │ │                 │     │\n│ │  [Live Preview] │   │ │  [Live Preview] │     │\n│ │                 │   │ │                 │     │\n│ │   [💾 Save]     │   │ │   [💾 Save]     │     │\n│ └─────────────────┘   │ └─────────────────┘     │\n└───────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘\n│ [Refresh All] [Screenshot All]    [📚 Library]  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### Core Viewer\n- **2x2 resizable grid** of iframe panels\n- **Per-panel URL** (localhost:3001, 3002, 3003, 3004 or custom)\n- **Per-panel label** (agent name/config for reference)\n- **Auto-refresh** when dev servers hot reload\n- **Responsive** - stack to 2x1 or 1x1 on mobile\n\n### Panel Controls\n- URL input (editable)\n- Label/name input\n- Refresh button\n- Open in new tab\n- Fullscreen single panel\n- **Save component** button\n\n### Component Library (New)\nSave winning components for re-use with full metadata:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ 📚 Saved Components                    [Search] │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │\n│ │ Login Form v2                    2026-01-13 │ │\n│ │ ─────────────────────────────────────────── │ │\n│ │ Agent: opus + coder agent                   │ │\n│ │ Prompt: \"Build a login form with email,    │ │\n│ │         password, remember me checkbox,    │ │\n│ │         and forgot password link\"          │ │\n│ │ Files: components/LoginForm.tsx            │ │\n│ │        components/LoginForm.css            │ │\n│ │ ─────────────────────────────────────────── │ │\n│ │ [Preview] [Copy Files] [Re-run Prompt]     │ │\n│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │\n│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │\n│ │ Dashboard Card                   2026-01-12 │ │\n│ │ ...                                         │ │\n│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Saved metadata per component:**\n- Component name (user-provided)\n- Timestamp\n- Agent config (model, system prompt, flags)\n- Prompt used to create it\n- Source files (paths or inline code)\n- Screenshot thumbnail\n- Tags for organization\n\n**Library actions:**\n- **Preview** - View saved screenshot/code\n- **Copy Files** - Copy component files to clipboard or target directory\n- **Re-run Prompt** - Send same prompt to new agent session\n- **Edit metadata** - Update name, tags, notes\n- **Delete** - Remove from library\n\n### Comparison Tools\n- **Refresh all** - reload all 4 panels\n- **Screenshot all** - capture current state of all 4\n- **Save comparison** - save URLs + labels to localStorage\n- **Load comparison** - restore saved configurations\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### File Structure\n```\napp/sections/prompts-playground.tsx     # Main section\ncomponents/prompts/\n  QuadSplitViewer.tsx                   # 2x2 resizable grid\n  BrowserPanel.tsx                      # Single iframe panel\n  PanelControls.tsx                     # URL, label, refresh, save\n  ComparisonToolbar.tsx                 # Bulk actions\n  ComponentLibrary.tsx                  # Saved components view\n  SaveComponentDialog.tsx               # Save form with metadata\n  ComponentCard.tsx                     # Library item display\nlib/prompts-playground.ts               # Types, localStorage helpers\n```\n\n### Types\n```typescript\ninterface PanelConfig {\n  url: string;

Add icon property to each CATEGORY definition (e.g., Info → Globe, Productivity → CheckSquare, etc.)\n2. When collapsed, show only category icons vertically (not individual section icons)\n3. Clicking category icon in collapsed state → shows flyout with that category's sections\n4. Working dir selector: use Popover/Portal so it can open without expanding sidebar\n5.

{"id":"personal-homepage-jaj","title":"Investigate TabzChrome new tab search bar for Search Hub enhancements","description":"The TabzChrome new tab page has a search bar that matches against multiple sources:\n- Bookmarks\n- Terminal profiles\n- And more\n\nThis works really well and could inform enhancements to the Search Hub section or provide a unified quick-launch experience.\n\nReference: ~/projects/TabzChrome new tab page implementation","notes":"## Research Findings: TabzChrome New Tab Search Bar\n\n### 1. How the CommandBar Works\n\nThe search bar is implemented in `extension/newtab/components/CommandBar.tsx`. Key features:\n\n- **Single unified input** with `$` prefix aesthetic (terminal-style)\n- **Live suggestions dropdown** appearing as user types\n- **Auto-focus on mount** with 300ms delay for smooth UX\n- **Debounced bookmark search** (150ms) to avoid excessive API calls\n\n### 2. Search Sources\n\nThe CommandBar searches against **4 data sources**:\n\n1. **URLs** - Detects URL patterns (http/https or domain-like strings like `github.com`)\n2. **Terminal Profiles** - Matches profile name OR category via simple `includes()` string matching\n3. **Recent Directories** - File paths matching the query\n4. **Chrome Bookmarks** - Using `chrome.bookmarks.search()` API with 150ms debounce\n\nFallback: If no matches found and not a URL, suggests a Google search.\n\n### 3. Matching Logic\n\n**NOT fuzzy matching** - uses simple `toLowerCase().includes()` for profiles/dirs.\n\nMatching priorities in suggestion generation order:\n1. URL detection first (if looks like URL)\n2. Profile matches (up to 4 results)\n3. Directory matches (up to 3 results)\n4. Bookmark matches (up to 5 results)\n5. Fallback search suggestion\n\n### 4. UI Patterns\n\n**Keyboard Navigation:**\n- `ArrowDown/Tab` - Next suggestion\n- `ArrowUp/Shift+Tab` - Previous suggestion\n- `Enter` - Execute selected action\n- `Escape` - Close suggestions, clear input\n- `/` key (from NewTab.tsx) - Focus search from anywhere on page\n- `1-9` keys - Quick spawn profiles by index\n\n**Visual Design:**\n- Each suggestion has: icon, title, subtitle, action badge\n- Color-coded icons by type (profile color or amber for bookmarks)\n- Selected state with left border accent\n- CRT-inspired aesthetic with scanlines/noise overlays\n\n**Suggestion Item Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface Suggestion {\n  type: 'profile' | 'url' | 'search' | 'dir' | 'bookmark'\n  id: string\n  title: string\n  subtitle?: string\n  icon?: React.ReactNode\n  color?: string\n  action: () =\u003e void\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Additional Features\n\n**Omnibox Integration** (`background/omnibox.ts`):\n- `term \u003ccommand\u003e` from Chrome address bar\n- Profile suggestions, URL handling, common commands\n- Max 5 suggestions\n\n**Web Shortcuts Grid:**\n- Pulls from Chrome bookmarks \"New Tab\" or \"Favorites\" folder\n- Google favicon API for icons\n- Grid layout with hover effects\n\n### 6. Enhancement Ideas for Search Hub\n\n**High-Impact:**\n1. **Unified quick-launch bar** - Single input that searches bookmarks + engines + AI services\n2. **Keyboard shortcuts** - `1-9` for engine selection, `/` to focus\n3. **Suggestion dropdown** - Show matching bookmarks/recent searches as user types\n4. **Type-ahead with categories** - Group suggestions by source (bookmark, engine, recent)\n\n**Medium-Impact:**\n1. **Command palette style** - `Cmd+K` to open overlay search\n2. **Shortcut prefixes** - `b:` for bookmarks, `g:` for google, etc.\n3. **Debounced search** - Prevent excessive API calls while typing\n4. **Mouse hover selection** - Update selected index on hover\n\n**Lower-Priority:**\n1. **Recent directories** integration (if terminal support exists)\n2. **Chrome bookmarks API** (would need extension context)\n3. **CRT visual effects** (might not fit homepage aesthetic)\n\n### Key Files Reference\n\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/newtab/components/CommandBar.tsx` - Main search component\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/newtab/NewTab.tsx` - Parent with keyboard shortcuts\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/newtab/styles/newtab.css` - Styling patterns\n- `~/projects/TabzChrome/extension/background/omnibox.ts` - Address bar integration","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-04T23:06:59.135697628-05:00","created_by":"matt","updated_at":"2026-01-05T09:53:28.014469186-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-05T09:53:28.014469186-05:00","close_reason":"Research complete: Documented TabzChrome CommandBar patterns, search sources, and enhancement ideas for Search Hub in issue notes"}
